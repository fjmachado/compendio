abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Sociedade Brasileira de Fitopatologia.Gibberella ear rot (GER) of maize is of common occurrence in southern Brazil. The increased risk of the disease in this region is associated with wide adoption of no-till and seasonal weather conducive for epidemics, thus requiring fungicide applications to protect against the disease. However, limited information is available about the best timing for fungicide applications aiming at disease suppression. A two-year split-plot randomized complete block design experiment was conducted to determine whether early or late application of a fungicide at various intervals up to week relative to inoculation 5–6 days after silk emergence affects disease control. Treatments consisted of an application of a mix of three active ingredients present in two commercial formulations (azoxystrobin + cyproconazole and carbendazim) at different times relative to inoculation: 2, 4 or 6 days either prior (preventatively) or after (curatively) inoculation. The non-treated check consisted of non-sprayed plots. All plots were inoculated using the silk-channel-method by injecting 2 ml of macroconidia suspension (2 × 105 macroconidia/ml) of an aggressive F. meridionale isolate at 5–6 days after silk-emergence. The mean GER severity of the non-treated plots was 24.4 and 27.1 {\%} for Maximus and P32R48H hybrids, respectively. Mean GER severity differed among application times for both hybrids (P {\textless} 0.0001). The application timing of 2, 4, and 6 days showed an average control efficacy of 52, 34, and 20 {\%}, for Maximus hybrid and 40, 15, and 9 {\%} for P32R48H hybrid. Although maize yield was not significantly improved, a fungicide application at two days around inoculation (preventative or curative) was the best fungicide application timing to reduce GER severity in matured grain, and could be incorporated into a disease management program.},

abstract = {Fungicide application is a key factor in the control of mycotoxin contamination in the harvested wheat grain. However, the practical results are often disappointing. In 2000-2004, 2006-2008 and 2007 and 2008, three experiments were made to test the efficacy of fungicide control on Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) in wheat and to find ways to improve control of the disease and toxin contamination. In a testing system we have used for 20 years, tebuconazole and tebuconazole + prothioconazole fungicides regularly reduced symptoms by about 80{\%} with a correlating reduction in toxin contamination. Averages across the years normally show a correlation of r = 0.90 or higher. The stability differences (measured by the stability index) between the poorest and the best fungicides are about 10 or more times, differing slightly in mycotoxin accumulation, FHB index (severity) and Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK). The weak fungicides, like carbendazim, were effective only when no epidemic occurred or epidemic severity was at a very low level. Similar fungicide effects were seen on wheat cultivars which varied in FHB resistance. In this study, we found three fold differences in susceptibility to FHB between highly susceptible and moderately resistant cultivars when treated with fungicides. In the moderately resistant cultivars, about 50{\%} of the fungicide treatments lowered the DON level below the regulatory limit. In the most susceptible cultivars, all fungicides failed to reduce mycotoxin levels low enough for grain acceptance, in spite of the fact that disease was significantly reduced. The results correlated well with the results of the large-scale field tests of fungicide application at the time of natural infection. The Turbo FloodJet nozzle reduced FHB incidence and DON contamination when compared to the TeeJet XR nozzle. Overall, the data suggest that significant decreases in FHB incidence and deoxynivalenol contamination in field situations are possible with proper fungicide applications. Additionally, small plot tests can be used to evaluate the quality of the field disease and toxin production.},

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease of wheat caused by Fusarium graminearum, and its associated toxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON), are best managed by integrating multiple strategies. Experiments were established in 2011 and 2013 to evaluate the effects of integrating cultivar resistance, fungicide application, and grain harvesting strategy on FHB index (IND; field severity), DON, grain yield (YLD), and grain test weight (TW; weight per unit volume). Plots of two moderately resistant and two susceptible cultivars were either treated with 19{\%} tebuconazole + 19{\%} prothioconazole or left untreated, and then inoculated with F. graminearum. IND was rated as the mean percentage of diseased spikelets per spike. Separate subsets of the plots of each cultivar–treatment combination were harvested with one of two combine harvester configuration: C1 (the default, set at a fan speed of 1,375 rpm and a shutter opening of 70 mm) and C4 (modified, with the same fan speeds but a wider shutter opening of 90 mm). YLD and TW data were collected, and grain samples were rated for percent Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) and tested for DON. Results from linear mixed-model analyses showed that the cultivar– treatment interaction was significant for all FHB-related responses, with the magnitude of the difference in mean arcsine-square-root-transformed IND and FDK (arcIND and arcFDK) and log-transformed DON (logDON) between treated and untreated being higher for susceptible than moderately resistant cultivars. Plots harvested with the C4 combine configuration had significantly higher mean TW than those harvested with C1. Treated plots had significantly higher YLD and TW than untreated plots, regardless of cultivar and configuration. Relative to the reference management program (untreated, susceptible cultivar, harvested with C1), the greatest percent reduction in FDK and DON and increase in YLD was observed for programs that included moderate resistance and fungicide treatment. The greatest percent increase in TW relative to the reference was observed when C4 adjusted combine setting was integrated with resistance and fungicide. Overall, the most effective management programs all included fungicide treatment, two included moderate resistance, and two included C4 combine setting. Relative to the reference management program, these programs resulted in 30 to 51{\%} reduction in total estimated price discount, {\$}127 to 312 ha–1 increase in gross cash income, and economic benefit of {\$}31 to 272 ha–1, depending on the level of FHB IND (5 to 15{\%}), grain price ({\$}118 to 276 metric ton–1), and fungicide application cost ({\$}40 to 96 ha–1).},

Plant Dis. 95:1448-1457. Fusarium head blight (FHB) reduces wheat grain yield and quality, leading to price discounts due to Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination of grain, and reduced test weight (weight per unit volume of grain). Experiments were conducted to determine whether changing combine harvester configurations to differentially remove diseased kernels affected the yield and quality of grain harvested from plots with different mean levels of FHB index (IND, mean proportion of diseased spikelets per spike), achieved with inoculations at different spore densities. Plots were harvested using four combine configurations, with Cl being the standard, set at a fan speed of 1,375 rpm and a shutter opening of 70 mm, and C2, C3, and C4 regulated to fan speeds and shutter openings of 1,475 rpm and 70 mm, 1,475 rpm and 90 mm, and 1,375 rpm and 90 mm, respectively. C3 and C4 consistently had significantly lower mean arcsine-transformed FDK and log-transformed DON and higher mean test weight than did C I. However, C3 and C4 also resulted in significantly lower mean amounts of harvested grain than did C I. The estimated mean responses to combine configuration were consistent across a range of mean IND levels (5 to 35{\%}). Using a common price discount schedule based on the incidence of FDK, DON, and test weight, and the mean values found in the current investigation for these grain-quality variables, configurations C2, C3, and C4 resulted in between {\$}10 and 40/t lower estimated grain price discounts than Cl, with the lowest discounts corresponding to C3 and C4. Using the discount values, a range of grain prices, and the mean yield values from this investigation, estimated gross cash income (GO; mean estimated yield x grain price adjusted for discounts due to inferior quality) was generally higher for grain harvested with C2 and C4 than with Cl or C3, with C4 being the most consistent across a range of IND levels (5 to 35{\%}) and grain prices ({\$}118 to 276/t). For all modified configurations, the greatest increases in GCI over Cl were observed at the lowest tested grain price, and the improvement of GCI over C 1 increased with increasing IND up to the highest disease level tested. Thus, these results showed that, when harvesting grain from FHB-affected fields, the improvement in grain quality and reduction in price discounts with a combine adjustment could be great enough to counteract the reduction in harvested grain that results from the adjustment..},

abstract = {Seven field experiments were conducted in Ohio and Illinois between 2011 and 2013 to evaluate post-anthesis applications of prothioconazole + tebuconazole and metaconazole for Fusarium head blight and deoxynivalenol (DON) control in soft red winter wheat. Treatments consisted of an untreated check, and fungicide applications made at early anthesis (A), 2 (A+2), 4 (A+4), 5 (A+5), or 6 (A+6) days after anthesis. Six of the seven experiments were augmented with artificial Fusarium graminearum inoculum and the other naturally infected. FHB index (IND), Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK) and DON concentration of grain were quantified. All application timings led to significantly lower mean arcsine-square-root-transformed IND and FDK (arcIND and arcFDK) and log-transformed (logDON) than in the untreated check; however, mean arcIND, arcFDK, and logDON for the post-anthesis applications were generally not significantly different from those for the anthesis applications. Relative to the check, A+2 resulted in the highest percent control for both IND and DON, 69 and 54{\%}, respectively, followed by A+4 (62 and 52{\%}), A+6 (62 and 48{\%}) and A (56 and 50{\%}). A+2 and A+6 significantly reduced IND by 30 and 14{\%}, respectively, relative to the anthesis application. Post-anthesis applications did not, however, reduce DON relative to the anthesis application. These results suggest that applications made up to 6 days following anthesis may be just as effective as, and sometimes more effective than, anthesis applications at reducing FHB and DON.},

abstract = {The toxicity of the mycotoxins nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON) and fumonisin B1 (FB1) were studied in the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line using the Trypan Blue, MTT and BrdU uptake analyses of cytotoxicity, cell metabolism and cell proliferation, respectively. Nuclear staining with propidium iodide and DNA analysis by flow cytometry were used to identify apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. By the MTT and BrdU tests, both NIV and DON were significantly more toxic than FB1 by at least one order of magnitude, with ID50s ranging from 0.5 ??M for NIV to 70 ??M for FB1. The MTT test indicated that NIV was significantly (approximately four times) more toxic than DON. In contrast, the Trypan Blue test did not reveal any effects of mycotoxin exposure suggesting that, at the concentrations tested, NIV, DON and FB1 did not induce cytotoxicity through plasma membrane damage. Cell cycle analysis suggested apoptotic cytotoxicity, revealing 100{\%} cellular debris at the highest concentrations of NIV and DON and approximately 2.9 times more debris than control at the highest FB1 concentration. Morphological evidence of apoptosis was related to the toxicity of the substances, such that the more toxic NIV and DON resulted in more late stage apoptotic events than FB1. This study suggests that human blood cells are sensitive to mycotoxin exposure, that NIV is more toxic than DON which is more toxic than FB1, and that DNA damage and apoptosis rather than plasma membrane damage and necrosis may be responsible for the observed cytotoxicity. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The isolates were characterized and compared for 14 different attributes of saprophytic fitness and pathogenic fitness on a susceptible wheat variety. Isolates of the two genotypes could not be differentiated for most of these traits. Three principle components-ascospore production on corn stalks, total trichothecene amount in wheat kernels, and incidence of diseased spikelets up from the point of inoculation-accounted for 29.4, 18.9, and 10.8{\%} of the variation among the isolates, respectively. A bootstrapping procedure grouped the isolates into two distinct groups, with 27 and 23 isolates each, with isolates from both genotypes represented in similar proportions (15-ADON/3-ADON, n = 14/13 and 11/12). Within the contemporary population of F. graminearum causing wheat head blight in New York, isolates with a 3-ADON genotype did not possess any detectable advantage over isolates with a 15-ADON genotype in saprophytic fitness or in pathogenic fitness on a susceptible wheat cultivar.},

abstract = {Fusarium head blight is a disease of primary concern to small-grain cereals of Brazil, including barley. Its main causal agent, Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex), is able to produce mycotoxins, especially deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV), that usually contaminate grain. Strains that produce DON may also produce its acetylated derivatives: 3-acetyl-DON (3-ADON) and 15-acetyl-DON (15-ADON). Ninety two isolates were obtained from samplings of barley grain during three years (2007, 2008 and 2009) from several fields in both southern and northern production regions of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. These isolates were examined for polymerase chain-reaction-based (PCR) trichothecene genotype based on the amplification of portions of Tri3 and Tri12. There was no effect of year or region on the proportion of trichothecene genotypes. Overall, 66{\%} of the strains (61/92) were 15-ADON, 4.4{\%} (4/92) were 3-ADON and 29.3{\%} (27/92) were NIV. The overall NIV/DON ratio estimated (0.41) was five times higher than that found in previous studies with strains from wheat grown in the same region. Species identification of nine strains representing the trichothecene genotypes, based on comparisons of DNA sequences of portions of the PHO, RED and URA genes with sequences from curated reference isolates of Fusarium from GenBank, revealed that they belong to F. graminearum sensu stricto (four 15-ADON and one 3-ADON strain), F. meridionale (three NIV strains) and F. austroamericanum (one 3-ADON strain). These results add to the current regional knowledge of trichothecene genotypes and species within the Fg complex affecting barley in the region. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sensitivity of Gibberella zeae to carbendazim was determined by measuring mycelial growth in fungicide-amended media. Among 1,529 isolates tested, 31 isolates showed a high level of resistance (HR) to carbendazim (fungicide concentration that results in 50{\%} inhibition of mycelial growth [EC(50)] of 10.35 to 30.26 mg a.i. liter(-1)) and 10 isolates were moderately resistant (MR) (EC(50) of 4.50 to 7.28 mg a.i. liter(-1)). The remaining 1,488 isolates were sensitive to carbendazim and were unable to grow on potato dextrose agar amended with carbendazim at 2 mg a.i. liter(-1). Analysis of DNA sequences of the beta 2-tubulin (Tub2) gene showed that all 10 MR isolates had a point mutation at codon 198 causing a replacement of glutamic acid by glutamine. At the codon position 167, the amino acid phenylalanine was replaced by tyrosine in 28 of 31 HR isolates. The remaining three HR isolates had a point mutation at codon 200 which converted phenylalanine to tyrosine. Based on these point mutations in the Tub2 gene, allele-specific polymerase chain reaction primers were developed for rapid detection of the point mutations. The rapid molecular method will be a valuable tool for the monitoring of carbendazim resistance in G. zeae. Additionally, deletion of the beta 1-tubulin gene (Tub1) in the HR isolate GJ33 resulted in increased resistance to carbendazim. These results indicate that Tub1 plays a role in the sensitivity of G. zeae to carbendazim.},

@article{Wegulo2012,
abstract = {Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum. These and other closely related fungi cause a disease known as Fusarium head blight (FHB) in small grain cereals. Other mycotoxins produced by FHB-causing fungi include nivalenol, T-2 toxin, and zearalenone. Ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated food and feed can lead to toxicosis in humans and animals, respectively. DON is the predominant and most economically important of these mycotoxins in the majority of small grain-producing regions of the world. This review examines the factors that influence DON accumulation in small grain cereals from an agricultural perspective. The occurrence and economic importance of FHB and DON in small grain cereals, epidemiological factors and cereal production practices that favor FHB development and DON accumulation in grain under field conditions, and regulatory/advisory standards for DON in food and feed are discussed. This information can be used to develop strategies that reduce DON accumulation in grain before harvest and to mitigate the human and animal health risks associated with DON contamination of food and feed.},

abstract = {A sample of 50 isolates, including 25 each of the 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol and the 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol trichothecene genotype, from a contemporary collection of Fusarium graminearum associated with Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat in New York varied in sensitivity to tebuconazole (effective concentration leading to a 50{\%} reduction of mycelial growth [EC50] of 0.28 to 8.09 mg/liter; $\mu$ = 1.12 mg/liter) and metconazole (0.05 to 0.86 mg/liter; $\mu$ = 0.33). Mean sensitivity did not differ between the trichothecene genotype groups. Isolate Gz448NY11 from Steuben County is the first tebuconazole-resistant field isolate of F. graminearum reported in the Americas and has the lowest sensitivity to tebuconazole (EC50 = 8.09 mg/liter) documented for this species. Suppression of FHB and deoxynivalenol (DON) following application of a commercial rate of tebuconazole was significantly diminished in plants inoculated with the tebuconazole-resistant isolate compared with those inoculated with a tebuconazole-sensitive isolate well documented for its aggressiveness and toxigenicity on wheat. There was no diminution of FHB and DON suppression with either isolate following application of metconazole. Significantly more individuals of the tebuconazole-resistant isolate were recovered from spikes inoculated with an equal mixture of the two isolates and sprayed with tebuconazole. Future studies are needed on the epidemiology and monitoring of triazole-resistant isolates to understand the risk that fungicide resistance poses to disease management and food security.},
